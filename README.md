=================

Series of scripts for compiling a de-duped title list of journals.

Scripts are to be run in numerical order, using source data as is modeled in the `samples/` folder. The ISSN-L data is available from the [ISSN center](http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-issn-l-table/).
